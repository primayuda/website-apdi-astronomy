Jakarta, Indonesia – March 15 – Today marked the launch of the "Indonesia's Digital Transformation Multi-Stakeholders Partnership," a new initiative to boost Indonesia's digital infrastructure and capabilities to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Seventy rectors from universities in Indonesia, heads of UN agencies, ambassadors, representatives from international organizations, and other stakeholders in Indonesia's digital development attended the launch in the Auditorium of BINUS University. 

Based on Presidential Regulation 82/2023 Accelerating Digital Transformation and Integrating National Digital Services, the Government of Indonesia, with the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform (PAN RB) as the coordinator has committed to realising quality public services and strengthening cyber and information security. 

"We fully understand that collaboration is very important. We are very open to support from UN agencies or other parties in various initiatives. With the upcoming government transition, the current momentum needs to be maintained and continued," Rini Widyantini, Secretary of the Ministry of PAN RB, said in her keynote speech at the launch of the partnership.  

Rini also explained some of the government's priorities related to digital transformation that require mutual support including the strengthening of the Electronic Based Government System (SPBE) team, institutional evaluation, policy evaluation, and enhancing the digital capabilities of the state apparatus.

This initiative was conceived by ten UN agencies, the Nationwide University Network of Indonesia (NUNI), and the Indonesian Digital Leaders Association (APDI) wishing to support the digital transformation in Indonesia, lessen the digital divide and promote inclusive digital education that helps propel economic expansion.

"Addressing the digital divide is crucial for harnessing digital technology to tackle global challenges such as poverty and climate change," stated Valerie Julliand, UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia. "Our collaboration seeks to ensure digital tools are accessible and benefit to all."

The partnership underscores the importance of digital access and literacy as foundational development elements, striving to address disparities in digital technology access and usage.

"BINUS University is proud to be one of the twenty-one universities in Indonesia (NUNI) that will collaborate closely with the United Nations (UN) and the Association of Indonesian Digital Leaders (APDI) to improve the digital literacy of Indonesian society and accelerate inclusive and sustainable digital transformation in the future," said Dr. Nelly, S.Kom., M.M., CSCA, Rector of BINUS University.

Addressing the Digital Divide for All

The initiative adopts a holistic approach, involving multiple societal sectors and concentrating on vital areas such as digital skills, security, ethics, culture, and the economy.  

This collaborative effort includes government entities, UN agencies, educational institutions, the private sector, and community organizations, all working together to cultivate a society capable of thriving in the digital age.

"This partnership highlights the significance of collective action in creating a society that leverages digital technology for empowerment and progress where it aligns closely with one of four pillars, which is in research and innovation to contribute to societal development," remarked Prof. Dr. Ir. Y. Budi Widianarko, M.Sc. NUNI Chairperson.

This multi-stakeholder partnership also recognizes the crucial role of gender and disability inclusion in achieving a truly equitable digital landscape. By prioritizing these aspects, the "Indonesia's Digital Transformation Multi-Stakeholders Partnership" further strengthens Indonesia's position in advocating for these crucial aspects at the upcoming UN Summit of the Future 2024, contributing to the development of a global digital compact that prioritizes equitable access and participation for all.
